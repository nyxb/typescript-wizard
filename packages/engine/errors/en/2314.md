It appears that '{0}' requires '{1}' type argument(s), which means you need to pass them in using a generic.

For example, consider this code:

```ts
class MyArray<T> {
  // ...
}

let arr = new MyArray();
```

In this case, the type argument for 'MyArray' is missing. I can't handle this because I don't know what type the elements of 'arr' should be.

You could make me happy by specifying the type argument, like so:

```ts
let arr = new MyArray<number>();
```

Now I know that 'arr' is a number array. That makes so much more sense!
