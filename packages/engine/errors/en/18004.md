You're attempting to use shorthand notation to add '{0}' as both the key and value to this object. However, before doing so, '{0}' needs to be declared as a variable or provided with an initializer. Here's an example of how you can resolve this issue:

```ts
const myKey = '{0}'
const myObject = {
   [myKey]: 'Value'
}
```

By declaring '{0}' as a variable first and then using it as the key in the object declaration, you can successfully add it to the object.
