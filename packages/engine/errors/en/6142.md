original: "Module '{0}' was resolved to '{1}', but '--jsx' is not set."
excerpt: "You can't import `.jsx` or `.tsx` files until you set `jsx` in your `tsconfig.json`."
---

This error occurs when you try to import `.jsx` or `.tsx` files, but the `jsx` setting in your `tsconfig.json` file is not configured correctly.

To resolve this issue, open your `tsconfig.json` file and ensure that the `jsx` setting is properly set. If you are using React with JSX, the value should be set to `react`. For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

Make sure to save your changes and rebuild your TypeScript project for the new settings to take effect. After that, you should be able to import `.jsx` or `.tsx` files without any errors.
