original: "Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided."
excerpt: "You can't use JSX yet because you haven't added `jsx` to your `tsconfig.json`."
---

This error occurs when you try to use JSX syntax but haven't added the `jsx` setting to your `tsconfig.json` file.

To resolve this issue, open your `tsconfig.json` file and add the `jsx` setting with the appropriate value. If you're using React with JSX, the value should be set to `react`. For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

Save your changes and rebuild your TypeScript project for the new settings to take effect. After that, you should be able to use JSX without any issues.
