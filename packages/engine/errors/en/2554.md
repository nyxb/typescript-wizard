original: 'Expected {0} arguments, but got {1}.'
excerpt: "The function you're trying to call needs {0} arguments, but you're passing {1}."
---

For example, consider the following code:

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
   console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
}

greet('Alice', 25)
```

In this case, you're trying to call the `greet` function with two arguments, but it expects only one argument. You should remove the extra argument:

```ts
greet('Alice')
```

Now you're passing the required argument, and the code will work as expected.
