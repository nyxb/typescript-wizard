original: "Property '{0}' is optional in type '{1}' but required in type '{2}'."
excerpt: "Property '{0}' in type '{2}' must exist."

Types `{1}` and `{2}` have the same property `{0}` but the property `{0}` is prefixed with `?` in type `{1}` which means it may not exist.

For example, the interface `{1}` declares that there is a property `{0}` which can be a `string` or it should not exist in the object:

```ts
interface {1} {
  {0}?: string;
}
interface {2} {
  {0}: string
}
const foo: {1} = {}  // OK: '{0}' doesn't exist in type '{1}'
const bar: {2} = foo // Error: '{0}' must exist in type '{2}'
```

Consider removing the prefix `?` from the property `{0}` in type `{1}` or adding the prefix `?` to the property `{0}` in type `{2}`.
