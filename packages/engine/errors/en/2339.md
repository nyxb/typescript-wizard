You're trying to access '{0}' on an object that doesn't contain it.

For example, consider this code:

```ts
interface MyInterface {
  prop1: string;
}

let obj: MyInterface = {
  prop1: "Hello",
};

console.log(obj.prop2);
```

In this case, 'prop2' does not exist in 'obj'. I'm confused because I don't know which property you're trying to access on 'obj'.

You could make me happy by accessing a valid property on 'obj', like so:

```ts
console.log(obj.prop1);
```

Now you're accessing the existing property 'prop1'. That makes much more sense!
