You're trying to call something that doesn't appear to be a function. A version of this error might be:

```ts
const a = '';
a();
```

In this case, you're trying to call the variable 'a' as a function. I'm confused because 'a' is an empty string and not a function. You can't call an empty string like a function.

You could make me happy by calling a valid function or ensuring that the variable you're trying to call is actually a function.
