You're trying to access '{0}' on an object that doesn't contain it. Did you mean '{2}'?

For example, consider this code:

```ts
const obj = { name: 'John' }
console.log(obj.age)
```

In this case, you're trying to access the property 'age' on the 'obj' object, but it doesn't exist. Did you mean to access the 'name' property instead?

```ts
console.log(obj.name)
```

Now you're accessing the correct property. That makes much more sense!
