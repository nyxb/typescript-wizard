You haven't passed all the required properties to '{1}' - you've missed out '{0}'.

For instance, consider this code:

```ts
interface MyInterface {
   prop1: string
   prop2: number
}

const obj: MyInterface = {
   prop1: 'Hello',
}
```

In this case, 'prop2' is missing in 'obj'. I'm confused because I expect 'obj' to have both 'prop1' and 'prop2'.

You could make me happy by adding the missing property, like so:

```ts
const obj: MyInterface = {
   prop1: 'Hello',
   prop2: 42,
}
```

Now 'obj' has all the properties I expect. That makes so much more sense!
