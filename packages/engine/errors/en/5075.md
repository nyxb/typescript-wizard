original: "'{0}' is assignable to the constraint of type '{1}', but '{1}' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{2}'."
excerpt: "You're passing a type '{0}' into a slot which is too narrow. It could be as wide as anything assignable to '{2}'."

This error occurs when you're trying to assign a type '{0}' to a constrained type '{1}', but the constrained type '{1}' could potentially be instantiated with a different subtype of the constraint '{2}'. In simpler terms, the type you're passing is compatible with the constraint, but it might not cover the full range of possible subtypes allowed by the constraint.

Here's a brief code example to illustrate the issue:

```ts
type Constraint<T extends string> = T

function processValue<T extends Constraint<'A'>>(value: T) {
   // ...
}

const value = 'B'
processValue(value) // Error: 'string' is assignable to the constraint 'Constraint<"A">', but 'Constraint<"A">' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'string'.
```

In this example, the `processValue` function expects a value of type `'A'` or a subtype of it. However, we're trying to pass a value of type `'B'`, which is not a valid subtype according to the constraint. The error indicates that the passed type is assignable to the constraint, but the constraint itself could potentially be instantiated with a different subtype, such as `'C'` or `'D'`.

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that the value you pass satisfies the constraint by being of the correct type or a valid subtype.
