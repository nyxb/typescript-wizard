This could be one of two possibilities - either '{0}' does not exist on your file system, or I can't find any corresponding type declarations for it.

For instance, consider this code:

```ts
import { MyClass } from 'nonexistent-module'
```

In this case, I can't find a module named 'nonexistent-module'. I'm confused because I don't know where to look for the definitions of the things you're trying to import.


You could make me happy by either creating the module file, or installing it if it's a package, like so:

```sh
npm install nonexistent-module
```

Or by adding the necessary type declarations if they're missing:

```ts
declare module 'nonexistent-module' {
   export class MyClass {
      // ...
   }
}
```

Now I know where to find 'MyClass'. That clears things up!
