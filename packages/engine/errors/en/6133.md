I noticed that '{0}' has been declared in your code, but it's never actually used or accessed. This means that you have created a variable or constant, but you never read or utilize its value anywhere in the code.

Having declared but unused variables can indicate potential issues or unnecessary code. If you don't intend to use the variable, it is recommended to remove it to keep your code clean and avoid any confusion. However, if you do intend to use the variable, make sure to utilize it appropriately at the relevant places in your code to ensure its functionality.
