You're trying to pass in '{0}' into a slot where I can only see that '{1}' can be passed.

For example, consider this code:

```ts
function processValue<T extends string>(value: T): void {
  // ...
}

processValue(42);
```

In this case, you're trying to pass in a number (42) into a function that expects a string. I'm confused because the function expects a string value, but you're providing a number.

You could make me happy by passing in a valid string value, like so:

```ts
processValue("Hello");
```

Now you're passing in a string value that satisfies the constraint. That makes much more sense!
