## v0.0.2


### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **bundleErrors.ts:** Add support for bundling errors for multiple languages The `bundleErrors` function now takes a `language` parameter, which specifies the language for which the errors should be bundled. The function now reads the error files from the directory corresponding to the specified language. The output file is now named `bundleErrors_{language}.json`, where `{language}` is the specified language. This change allows for bundling errors for multiple languages, which is useful for internationalization. ([e6721b6](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/e6721b6))
  - **humaniseDiagnostic.ts:** Add support for multiple languages The `humaniseDiagnostic` function now accepts a `language` parameter, which is used to determine which language file to use for error translations. The `bundleErrors` import has been replaced with two separate imports for English and German translations. The `getMessageTemplate` function has been refactored to remove unnecessary if-else statements. The link to the translation website has been updated to point to the new website. ([bd7a234](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/bd7a234))
  - **language.ts:** Add function to get current language from VSCode configuration This commit adds a new file `language.ts` which exports a function `getCurrentLanguage()`. This function retrieves the current language setting from the VSCode configuration for the extension `typeScriptWizard`. If the language is not set, it defaults to English. The function returns the current language as a string, either 'en' for English or 'de' for German. ([e4fc9d1](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/e4fc9d1))
  - **types.ts:** Add language property to Options interface The Options interface now includes a new property called language. This property will be used to store the language preference of the user. ([bfeabf8](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/bfeabf8))
  - **next.config.js:** Add i18n configuration to support multiple languages The i18n configuration has been added to the next.config.js file to support multiple languages. The locales array contains the supported languages, and the defaultLocale specifies the default language. This change allows the application to be more accessible to users who speak different languages. ([260056a](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/260056a))
  - **i18n.ts:** Add i18n configuration file with support for English and German translations This commit adds a new file `i18n.ts` which contains the configuration for the i18n library. The configuration includes support for English and German translations, with English being the fallback language. The `i18next-http-backend` package is used to load the translations from JSON files. The `detection` configuration is set to use the querystring to determine the language, and the cache is disabled. ([d0196dd](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/d0196dd))
  - **translations:** Add translations for TypeScript Wizard app in English and German The commit adds two new files, en.json and de.json, which contain translations for the TypeScript Wizard app. The translations include the title, description, header subtitle, header title, submit button text, error text, translation text, explanation text, and other relevant text. The addition of these translations will allow users who speak English and German to use the app in their native language. ([be1b36c](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/be1b36c))
  - **tipInfo.ts:** Add typeName property to TipInfoItem interface to provide a localized name for each tip The typeName property is added to the TipInfoItem interface to provide a localized name for each tip. This improves the readability of the code and makes it easier to understand what each tip is about. ([75914ef](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/75914ef))
  - **translate.ts): add support for multiple languages üêõ fix(translate.ts:** Fix typo in English excerpt The script now accepts a second argument for the language of the translation. The getTemplate function now takes the language argument and returns a template for the specified language. The English excerpt had a typo and has been fixed. ([444ea50](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/444ea50))
  - **index.tsx:** Add language selection feature to the web app The `Web` component now receives a `lang` prop, which is used to set the initial language flag in the `ReactFlagsSelect` component. The `getServerSideProps` function now also returns the `lang` value, which is passed as a prop to the `Web` component. This feature allows users to select their preferred language for the web app. ([93216a6](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/93216a6))
  - **web): add support for code highlighting in error messages üé® style(web:** Change color of code blocks to a more readable color The `prism-react-renderer` package was added to the `package.json` file to support code highlighting in error messages. The color of the code blocks was changed to a more readable color by adding a new color to the `tailwind.config.js` file. This improves the user experience by making error messages more readable and easier to understand. ([7f31455](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/7f31455))

  - **index.tsx:** Remove redundant code and simplify initial language flag assignment The initialLanguageFlag variable is now assigned directly based on the props.lang value, removing the need for a ternary operator. The setSelectedLanguage function now uses the initialLanguageFlag variable instead of a separate conditional statement. ([6e9b5db](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/6e9b5db))

### üíÖ Refactors

  - **extension.ts): rename configuration from 'wizardTypeScript' to 'typeScriptWizard' üåü feat(extension.ts): add support for localization of tip names and messages üêõ fix(extension.ts:** Fix command names for 'dont-show-again' and 'show-tip' The configuration name was changed to 'typeScriptWizard' to improve semantics.

([06f1501](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/06f1501))
  - **initDiagnostics.ts:** Add getCurrentLanguage function to get the current language and pass it to humaniseDiagnostic function The getCurrentLanguage function is added to get the current language of the VSCode editor.

([4e2cd96](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/4e2cd96))
  - **_app.tsx:** Add explicit types to MyApp function arguments The `MyApp` function now has explicit types for its arguments, which improves code readability and maintainability.

  - **de:** Improve translation and formatting of error message 2307 The translation of the error message has been improved to be more accurate and clear.

([e6ed240](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/e6ed240))
  - **humaniseDiagnostic.ts:** Use object to store translations and add language parameter to link The `currentLanguage` function is now called to get the current language. An object is created to store translations for the "See full translation" text. The `linkToTranslation` variable now includes the language parameter in the URL to allow the user to view the full translation in their preferred language. This improves the code's readability and maintainability by centralizing the translations in one place. ([1922b0e](https://github.com/nyxblabs/typescript-wizard/commit/1922b0e))
